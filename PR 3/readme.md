## 🔎 About the Project

In real-world data analytics, we rarely work with the entire population.  
This project shows how to:

- Draw **conclusions about a population using sample data**
- Perform **statistical tests correctly based on data type and sample size**
- Interpret results using **p-values, confidence intervals, and critical values**
- Present findings in an **exam-friendly and professional format**

The project is designed to be:
- ✔️ **Beginner-friendly**
- ✔️ **Exam-oriented**
- ✔️ **GitHub portfolio worthy**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply **Inferential Statistics** concepts on a real dataset  
- Perform and interpret:
  - Z-test & t-test (mean comparison)
  - Chi-square test (categorical association)
  - One-Way ANOVA (group comparison)
  - Correlation & Covariance (relationship analysis)
- Provide **clear Accept/Reject H₀ decisions**
- Present outputs in a way suitable for **university practical files and viva**
